# springboot-microservices
Three microservices : employee, department and organizanization, build using Spring Cloud technology and dockerized (based on java-guides). 

Developed with IntelliJ Idea 2022.3.1, Java version 17.0.5

First a folder called springboot-microservice was created in workspace.
Secondly, Employye and Department microservices each were generated with Spring Initializr. Downloaded and unzipt in that folder.
When in IntelliJ I open the springboot-microservice folder, all the application sub-folders are made to modules and thus, we can see
all microservices as modules to the springboot-microservice project. All in the same IntelliJ window.
Subsequent services are generated the same way, and manually added as "Imported module" in IntelliJ.
